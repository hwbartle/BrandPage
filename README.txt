The following was created for Broquet Co.. Use of any included documents with express approval and concent by Broquet is forbidden.

The objects are included specifically and explicity in order for it the be more easily used. A code generator was designed
in python to read in an excell file, and print out copy/paste-able JavaScript Code so that non-tech savy employees
could edit the site in the future. I also was limited on what I was personally allowed to upload into different files.


Due to the fact that the site was hosted on shopify, certian elements will not work unless hosted on that shopify. This includes:
	Background Color
	Default images for the brand catagories
	Popup and light box when a brand is clicked


If you would like to see a fully formed version of the site included, here is the uploaded version.
Be advised, this is running an older version of the code with was laid out more explicitly
